# Red-y-Set-Go: A Menstrual Cycle Tracking Website

<h3>Describe your project. Give a short description of what the general idea your team has.</h3>

<h6> * Neural Network - LSTM</h6>
- Tracks which period of the menstrual cycle the user is in: menstruation, the follicular phase, ovulation or the luteal phase
- Charts trends and predicts when the user is likely to get their next period

<h6> * Machine Learning - Predictive - based on the phases</h6>
- Hydration, Exercise
- Recommending a Skincare routine for the user

<h3>What is the purpose of your product? What problem are you trying to solve? Who is your target audience or consumer?</h3>
The problem: Women often get multiple pieces of advice about how to deal with their menstrual cycle, such as what to eat, whether or not they should exercise, etc
Target audience: People who menstruate - INCLUSIVE LANGUAGE!!
We also wanted to learn more about Neural Networks and Machine Learning, so we used this to learn more. 


<h3>What are the primary features you want to implement? This should be the barebones of your product, and serve the baseline functionalities.</h3>
- Should have a calendar showing the next predicted dates for menstruation.
- Should allow the user to see what phase they are currently in
- Allow users to input their age, height, weight. Focus on: period flow, state of mind, cramps.
- Allow users to take short notes
- Should give an exercise tab that displays how long to exercise and what kinds of exercises to avoid/focus on
- Recommended amount of water to drink

<h3>Give a brief description of the technology stack your team will use. (Ex: what back-end, front-end, database, frameworks, etc.)</h3>
- Frontend: DJANGO, JS
- SQL, Python - Tensorflow, PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, MatPlotLib/seaborn, HuggingFace

<h3>What are additional features your team may want to implement later on? What potential does your idea or project have?</h3>
- Integrate it with fitbit to track data automatically and reduce the required manual input
- Improve the LSTM Model using more data
- Recommending a skincare routines to avoid flare up, and possible supplements to take
